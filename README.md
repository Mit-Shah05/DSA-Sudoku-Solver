# DSA-Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku solver implemented using backtracking and recursion to demonstrate algorithmic problem solving.

# Overview
This project implements a Sudoku Solver using the backtracking algorithm. The goal is to automatically solve a valid 9×9 Sudoku puzzle by systematically exploring possible number placements while ensuring all Sudoku constraints are satisfied.

# How It Works
Uses recursion to try numbers from 1 to 9 in empty cells

Checks validity based on:

Row constraints

Column constraints

3×3 sub-grid constraints

Backtracks when a number placement leads to an invalid state

# Key Concepts Used
Backtracking

Recursion

Constraint checking

Logical problem solving

# Technologies Used
Python

# Usage
Provide a Sudoku puzzle with empty cells

Run the solver

The program outputs the completed Sudoku grid

# Learning Outcomes
Practical understanding of backtracking algorithms

Improved problem-solving and recursive thinking

Hands-on experience with classic DSA problems

# Academic Note
This project was developed as part of academic coursework to strengthen understanding of recursion and algorithmic problem-solving techniques.
